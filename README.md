Running locally you need 3 terminals open: 
one for client, one for server, and another one for MongoDB back-end. 
Below are the steps:

1. Install Node.js;
2. Install MongoDB;
3. git clone
4. Go to directory `client`, and run `npm install`;
5. Go to directory `server`, and run `npm install`;
6. In one terminal, run `mongod`;
7. In `server` directory, run `npm run dev`;
8. In `client` directory, run `npm run start`;

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to check the live application.
